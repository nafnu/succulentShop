                            <p>One of the gifts I received for my 16th birthday was a packet of mixed Cacti & Succulents seeds. All of the diverse shapes and colours of the little seedlings captivated me. I was soon reading any book I could get my hands on about cacti and succulents. I began purchasing seeds from more attractive, pleasant, and even unusual species. This was fascinating, cool, and exciting. These minor pleasures in life brought me great joy.</p>
                            <p class="mb-0"> My plants, seeds, and cuttings piqued people's interest. Slowly but steadily, an online store grew. I now own and operate NaffDecor.com, which I founded 25 years ago. Every day, growing and sharing succulents makes me feel happy. </p>
